<H1>Moving from PGP to <a HREF="http://www.d.shuttle.de/isil/gnupg/">GnuPG</a></H1>
<B>Arghhh! How do I switch to GnuPG when I (and my friends) already use PGP?</B>
<HR>
<P>I recently had my old PGP 5.0 key brought back from the dead when a 
colleague of mine wanted to send me some private info and all he had available
was PGP 5.5.  Luckily I had created a DSS key under 5.0 and so I figured I
may be able to make use of my old keys.  I regret not setting an expiration
date on my old key as it would have been very useful in this case.  I now have
four keys that I must deal with.  Two RSA (PGP 2.6), one DSS/Diffie-Hellman
 (PGP 5.0) and 
one DSA/ElGamal (GnuPG 3.6).
<P>Always set an expiration date on your keys.</P>
<P>That said, there are several issues at hand.  First, I have a pair of
DSS/Diffie-Hellman  keys that my friend is using PGP 5.5 to communicate
with me.  Second, I have a DSS/Diffie-Hellman public key that my friend 
is using.  Thirdly, I have a copy of gnupg 0.4.0.

<P>This document has two parts.  The first describes how to prepare to
<EM>encrypt</EM> messages to a user of PGP5.x.  The second details how
to take a PGP5.x KEY and install it on your GnuPG keyring so you may
<EM>decrypt</EM> messages from a PGP5.x user.</P>

<P>If these instructions do or do not work for you I would like to
hear about it.  Thanks to all the people on the GnuPG mailing list who
have unwittingly provided most of the information I used in creating
this.</P>

<P>In order to encrypt mail to my friend, I must be able to use GnuPG
to encrypt against a DSS/Diffie-Hellman key.  I used PGP to retrieve
his public key from the keys.pgp.com public key server.

<P>I take the resulting cyphertext and paste it into an email addressed
to my friend.  Now we wait....</P>

<P>We wait some more (my friend is notoriously slow to respond to messages).</P>

<P>Finally after a long (long) time, my friend responds that he was
able to read my message.  Of course, he is kind enough to use my PGP
key to send this. Thus we segue into the next section on using GnuPG
to decrypt messages sent by users of PGP5.0 to DSS/DH keys generated
by PGP5.0. 
</P>
<P>One important note is that my friend was using PGP5.5, not 5.0.  In 
later tests with pgp 5.0i I discovered that you must add two more parameters
to the encryption command.  Specifically <CODE>--no-armor --no-comment</CODE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Remember that <CODE>gpg --no-armor</CODE> will produce 'binary' output and so you
are wise to stick it in a file and then attach that file to an email.

<HR WIDTH="90%">

<P>Now the problem is, how do I make it so that my friend can use my GPG key
to send me messages?  Is this even possible?</P>

<P>I must now import my old DSS/Diffie-Hellman key onto
my GnuPG key ring.  This is not as easy as one may think.  It is complicated
by the fact that the PGP key utility <CODE>pgpk</CODE> does not have a
parameter for exporting a private key.  As luck would have it, superior
software packages such as GnuPG are capable of solving this problem for us.
<P>It is important to note that <B>this procedure puts your private key
at risk</B> for a short period of time and therefore <B>should not be done
on a multi-user or public system</B></P>

<H3>Step one: import your public key</H3>
<P>This is the easy part.  We use pgpk to extract your public key from
your keyring and import it into GnuPG.</P>

<P>Some of you have asked 'what the heck does the third instruction do?' It's actually
a rather simple trick.  The <CODE>mykey.sec</CODE> file contains an un-protected
secret key.  Obviously we want to get rid of it ASAP.  If we were to just <CODE>rm</CODE>
the file, yes that would eliminate the file, however the now unused blocks would be floating around
on the disk somewhere with your secret key bytes still in it. 
Not a terrible thing, but if you're going to jump off the building
from the 10th floor, why not make it the 100th and enjoy the view on the way down.
Seriously though, what we've done is take the GnuPG binary and overwritten the secret
key file.  This (mostly) ensures that the data is gone.  It isn't as strong as the
techniques used by the military (xor, 3 writes) but I'm assuming that you aren't worried
about someone disassembling your hard drive to find that file.</P>
